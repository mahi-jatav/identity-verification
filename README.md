# Identity Verification - Decentralized Identity Management System

## Project Description

The Identity Verification project is a blockchain-based decentralized identity management system built on Ethereum using Solidity. This smart contract enables users to register their identities on-chain while maintaining privacy and security through cryptographic hashing and access controls. The system allows authorized verifiers to validate identities, creating a trustless and transparent verification process.

The contract stores essential identity information such as name, email, date of birth, and document hashes (stored off-chain for privacy), while providing different levels of access to this information based on user permissions. This creates a secure, decentralized alternative to traditional centralized identity verification systems.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to create a world where individuals have complete control over their digital identities without relying on centralized authorities. By leveraging blockchain technology, we aim to:

- **Eliminate Identity Fraud**: Create immutable identity records that cannot be tampered with
- **Enhance Privacy**: Give users control over who can access their personal information
- **Reduce Verification Costs**: Minimize the need for repetitive identity verification processes
- **Enable Global Accessibility**: Provide identity services to underserved populations worldwide
- **Foster Trust**: Build a transparent system where verification status can be publicly verified

The ultimate goal is to establish a decentralized identity ecosystem that serves as the foundation for secure digital interactions across various platforms and services.

## Core Smart Contract Functions

### 1. `registerIdentity()` - Identity Registration
```solidity
function registerIdentity(
    string memory _name,
    string memory _email,
    uint256 _dateOfBirth,
    string memory _documentHash
) external
```
Allows users to register their identity on the blockchain with personal information and document verification.

### 2. `verifyIdentity()` - Identity Verification
```solidity
function verifyIdentity(address _user) external onlyVerifier
```
Enables authorized verifiers to verify registered identities after proper validation of submitted documents.

### 3. `getIdentity()` - Public Identity Information
```solidity
function getIdentity(address _user) external view returns (
    string memory name,
    bool isVerified,
    address verifier,
    uint256 verificationDate
)
```
Provides public access to basic identity information and verification status without exposing private details.
